# Codex Template

Clean starting point for Codex projects.

## Docs

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Rails-first structure and patterns to avoid. Use when shaping app layout.
- `docs/BASECAMP_RAILS_GUIDE.md` — practical Rails workflow + deploy norms. Use when deciding dev/test/deploy defaults.
- `docs/CODEX_CLI.md` — where Codex skills/history live. Use when working on agent tooling.
- `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` — core Rails principles + testing posture. Use for architectural tradeoffs.
- `docs/STYLE.md` — Ruby style + lint baseline. Use when editing or setting lint rules.
